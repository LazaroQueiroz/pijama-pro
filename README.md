# Pijama Pro

This project is a web application that allows users to visualize the classes offered by the Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), a Brazilian public university. The application was built using Flask, a web framework written in Python, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.

## Features

The application allows users to visualize the classes offered by UFCG in a user-friendly interface. Users can filter classes by semester, department, and course name. The application also provides a search bar that allows users to search for classes by keyword.

When a user selects a class from the list, the application displays more information about the class, including the class schedule, instructor, and classroom location.
